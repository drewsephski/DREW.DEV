# WobbleCard Component

The WobbleCard component is an interactive card with a dynamic wobble effect that responds to mouse movement.

## Import

```tsx
import { WobbleCard } from "@/components/ui/cards/wobble-card";
```

## Usage

```tsx
<WobbleCard>
  <h3>Card Title</h3>
  <p>Card content goes here.</p>
</WobbleCard>
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx
<WobbleCard>
  <h3>Interactive Card</h3>
  <p>Move your mouse over this card to see the wobble effect.</p>
</WobbleCard>
```

### Custom Container Class

```tsx
<WobbleCard containerClassName="bg-purple-800">
  <h3>Custom Background</h3>
  <p>This card has a purple background.</p>
</WobbleCard>
```

### Custom Content Class

```tsx
<WobbleCard className="text-center">
  <h3>Centered Content</h3>
  <p>This card has centered text content.</p>
</WobbleCard>
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | Required | The content to display inside the card |
| `containerClassName` | `string` | `undefined` | Additional CSS classes for the outer container |
| `className` | `string` | `undefined` | Additional CSS classes for the inner content |

## How It Works

The WobbleCard component:

1. Tracks mouse position relative to the card's center
2. Applies a subtle 3D transform to create a wobble effect
3. Moves the inner content in the opposite direction for a parallax effect
4. Includes a subtle noise texture for added visual interest

## Accessibility

- The wobble effect is purely decorative and doesn't affect screen readers.
- The component uses motion that respects user preferences for reduced motion.
- The effect is subtle enough to avoid causing discomfort for most users.
